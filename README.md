**Personal Finance and Expense Tracking System**

**Objective**
The goal of this project is to create a Python-based Personal Finance and Expense Tracking System that helps users monitor and manage their financial activities. The system will incorporate essential data science methodologies, coding practices, and interactive features to offer an engaging and functional application.

  **Key Features**
  
**Data Collection and Management**
User Data Input: Users will input their financial transactions, including income and expenses.
External Data Source Integration: Optionally, the system will connect to external APIs to fetch real-time exchange rates for multi-currency support.
Data Storage:
Transaction records will be stored in a relational database (e.g., SQLite or PostgreSQL).
Fields include: Date, Category, Amount, Description, and User ID.
User Account Management
Authentication: Users will log in with a username and password (secured with hashing).
Roles:
Regular Users: Can add/view/edit their financial data.
Admin: Can manage user accounts (create/delete).
Logout Functionality: A friendly message is displayed upon logout, followed by a timeout before exiting.
Statistical Analysis
Basic Statistics:
Total income and expenses over a selected period.
Average spending in different categories.
Advanced Analysis:
Expense trends over time.
Outlier detection for unusual spending patterns.
Budget variance analysis to identify deviations from planned budgets.
Visualization
Static Graphs:
Bar charts for expense categories.
Line graphs for income and savings trends.
Pie charts for spending distribution.
Interactive Dashboard:
A user-friendly interface to explore visualizations and statistics interactively.
Tools to adjust scales, filter data, and export reports.
User Interface
Command-Line Interface (CLI): Initial implementation for basic functionality.
Web-Based Frontend: Option to extend the project with a web interface for enhanced user experience using Flask, Dash, or Streamlit.
Why This Project?
Practical Relevance: Personal finance management is a universal need, ensuring the project is relatable and impactful.
Educational Value: Combines Python programming, data analysis, and visualization while adhering to good software practices.
Scalability: The modular structure allows for future enhancements, such as predictive analytics, multi-currency support, or budget alerts.
